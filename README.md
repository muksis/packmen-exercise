# PackMen Exercise

## Description
This factory for making PacMen is an MIT xPRO course assignment. By click the button 'Add PackMan' you can add as many PackMen as you want: they appear at different places on the screen one at time each time the button is clicked. When the 'Start Game' button is clicked the PackMen start moving in all directions at different velocities. New PackMen can be added both before and after the 'Start Game' button is pressed, continuous pressing of the 'Start Game' button increases the velocity of the PackMen movement.

## How to run
To run this exercise, clone the repository and simply open the file index.html in your preferred browser.

## Roadmap of future improvements
Adding ghosts and making PackMen face the direction they are headed each time they hit the walls.
